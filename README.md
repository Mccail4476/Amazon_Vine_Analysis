***Summary***

Since the percentage of vine reviews for 5 stars is significantly lower than the percentage of non-vine reviews for 5 stars, there is no positivity bias for reviews. If there were bias for the vine program, we can expect a huge jump in the vine reviews for 5 stars. 

An additional analysis to take the total number of five stars in the dataset, and display the percentage of vine versus non-vine to have a total value of 100%.
